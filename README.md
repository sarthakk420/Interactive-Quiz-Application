I designed and developed an interactive web-based quiz application using Spring Boot. By leveraging Spring Data JPA with PostgreSQL, I efficiently managed quiz questions through CRUD operations. To ensure application reliability, I implemented robust error handling and HTTP response management. Additionally, I developed intuitive user interfaces for seamless quiz participation and an administrative panel for content management. The integration of quiz submission and scoring functionalities provided immediate feedback, optimizing user interaction and experience.
